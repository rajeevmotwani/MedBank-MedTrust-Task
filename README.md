# Task Description
You assume the role of a data analyst at MedBank. A cooperative bank specializing in the healthcare market.

You have just received your new project and the associated dataset unknown to you.

Their task is to create the best possible forecasting model for a marketing campaign for a new product "MedTrust" and to predict the completion probabilities.

Analyze the training data set for this purpose.

First carry out an exploratory analysis : For which of the explanatory variables are correlations to the target variable observed? Which ones are technically meaningful?

Make a selection of explanatory variables and then create various predictive models (logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests).

Create different models with different parameters for each procedure . Proceed as systematically as possible so that you can later describe the performance of the model (= AUC) as a function of the parameters.

Apply this model to forecast the test data.
